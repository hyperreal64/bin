# bin

This gets cloned into my user's home directory at ~/bin:

``` shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/hyperreal64/bin ~/bin
```

Most of these scripts utilize [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum), so it would need to be installed on the system for the scripts to run. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink them in place.
